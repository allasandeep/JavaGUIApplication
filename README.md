# Java-GUI-Application-
The purpose of this assignment is to write a Java GUI application with which a travel agent could present options for travel destinations to a client who wants to redeem his or her accumulated frequent flyer miles. Assuming all trips depart from O'Hare International Airport and that the miles represented are for a roundtrip ticket. You can input your own data file.

This is how the output looks.
